/**
* @class Global
* @brief Makes a class globally accessible when inherited from
* @details Could easily be called a Singleton as well since there is only one instance of the class
*          but it is generally used more to make a class that is needed in a lot of peices of code.
*          An example of this is the operating system, storage, logging, FoundationMain, etc.
* @tparam T The class type to make globally accessible
* @tparam Args The argument types that need to be passed to the constructor of T
* 
* @attention Do not abuse this. Global access is not cohesive, connascent, or loosely coupled and can easily lead
*            to spaghetti code. If you're having trouble accessing certain data, consider adding parameters to your
*            constructor and member variables to your class or think about alternative places to access the data. 
*            Don't immediately think of globals as the solution.
* @code
*  class MyClass : public Fnd::Global<MyClass, int> {
*     public:
*        MyClass(int arg) : _arg(arg) {}
* };
* 
* //Call and create as a global
* MyClass::Init(10);
* //Call into the class
* MyClass::Instance().foo();
* //Create another class but not as a global. Call directly to the ctor and bypass the Init function
* MyClass *myClass = new MyClass(10);
* @endcode
